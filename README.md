# Playground
- Playground is a bare bones setup to start developing a Spring Boot application and deploy directly to WebSphere Liberty with ease in Eclipse

## Build
1. Run `mvn clean install`
2. Build the application in eclipse if "Build Automatically" is not enabled
3. Add **playground** to Liberty through Eclipse's IBM Liberty tool
4. Run/Debug the server. If you see the Spring Banner in the console, you likely completed the build successfully
